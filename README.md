# Golang REST API Template

This repository provides a minimalistic template for building a REST API in Golang without using any third-party web frameworks. Designed to be simple, lightweight, and extendable, this template is ideal for developers looking to build APIs with full control over their codebase and dependencies.

### Features:
- **Pure Golang Implementation**: No external frameworks, focusing on Go's standard library (`net/http`).
- **Clean Project Structure**: Organized into clear layers (handlers, services, models) for scalability and maintainability.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable for adding new routes, middlewares, and services.
- **JSON-based Routing**: Basic routing system using Go's built-in HTTP package.
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports `.env` files for configuration management.
- **Basic Error Handling**: Includes common error responses and structured error handling.

### Ideal For:
- Developers who prefer minimal dependencies and want full control over their API stack.
- Learning purposes to understand the core concepts behind building APIs in Go.
- Small to medium projects that require lightweight, efficient REST APIs.

Feel free to customize and extend the template according to your project's needs!
